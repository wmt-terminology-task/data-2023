# Data explained

The alignment was generated with GPT-4 and then validated by linguists. Linguist checking the English-German pair claimed it is without any issues and that's the data used in the evaluation.

However, we asked another linguist to validate English-German pair again and this lead to updated file `Second_annotator_unused_Terminology_human_checked_en_de.txt`. These annotations have not been used for the shared task findings and we release them as is for future research.
